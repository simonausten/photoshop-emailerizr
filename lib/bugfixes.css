From there it forces you to do all of your spacing inline during the development process. 
Be sure to stick to margins because paragraph padding is not supported by Outlook 2007/2010
Remember: Outlook.com does not support "margin" nor the "margin-top" properties.  
Stick to "margin-bottom", "margin-left", "margin-right" in order to control spacing
It also doesn't hurt to set the inline margin-top to "0" for consistency in Gmail

Another option:  Use double BRs instead of paragraphs */
